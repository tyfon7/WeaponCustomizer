# Weapon Customizer

This SPTarkov mod allows you to adjust the positions of some of your weapon attachments. This is a purely aesthetic mod - it has no effect on weapon statistics.

## How to use

Modify a gun with the context menu -> Modding screen, and you will be able to click and drag the white dot on each attachment. If it changes color, it's adjustable. If not, it's not.

You can reset an attachment to its default position by right clicking the dot, or reset all attachments by clicking "Revert" in the upper right corner.

Note that there is nothing currently enforcing the laws of physics - you can drag attachments into space, or inside of other attachments, and they will stay there. The only way to solve this would be an exhaustive list of every attachement's dimensions (which wouldn't support extra mod content), or a very complicated and likely wrong on-the-fly analysis of where items can be moved to. Use your own judgement.

## Presets

Adjustments can be saved as part of a preset. Changes are treated the same as any other preset change - they do not apply to the weapon until you click "Assemble", and they do not save until you press "Save".

## Supported attachments

### Foregrips

You can adjust foregrips forward and backwards. The operator's hand will stay on the grip.

### Tactical devices

Similarly, you can move lights and lasers and such. Moving them too far back will likely cause shadows!

### Scopes and optics

Scopes can be moved, but be aware that when aiming, different scopes behave differently. Moving iron sights, reflex sights, etc., will affect how the scope appears and how it lines up. Sniper scopes are handled differently by the game, and will still fill the screen the same amount, regardless of position. Check out Fontaine's FOV Fix!

### Stocks

Stocks are adjustable, but this will not affect how far off your chest the weapon is held.
